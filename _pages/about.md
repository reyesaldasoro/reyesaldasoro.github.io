### About Me


I am a Senior Lecturer at the School of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences at [City, University of London](https://www.city.ac.uk/). I am part of the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.city.ac.uk/about/schools/mathematics-computer-science-engineering/computer-science) within the school of School of Mathematics, Computer Science & Engineering. I am a member of the [giCentre](https://www.gicentre.net/) and my research focus is on the analysis, interpretation and visualisation of data, primarily related with biomedical experimentation.



### My areas of interest

My area of research is Image Analysis of Biomedical Images. This research covers three particular areas: the acquisition (I have worked with  light and fluorescent microscopes as well as access to confocal and multiphoton microscopes) of biomedical images, the analysis through algorithms, mathematical models and statistical methodologies, which provide quantitative measurements, and the interpretation of the data (2D images, 3D volumes, 2D+t videos, 3D+t volumetric time lapse data sets). This final stage is crucial, what conclusions can we draw from the images? Can we reveal something of the underlying biological processes of cells or tumours? What are the effects of drugs or treatments? By using image analysis we are able to extract a wealth of information that is present in the images we capture, and that it is not possible to obtain by simple qualitative analysis.

My overall objective is to shed some light into the causes and processes of human illnesses especially cancer, and the infection or inflammation processes related to this diseas. By analysing the images and videos from many experiments I hope to and contribute in finding ways to cure and prevent them.

I have analysed different biological processes - cell migration, vascular permeability, red cell velocity, inflammation - and this research has lead to more than 50 journal papers.


### Academic Background

My undergraduate degree is from the  [National University in Mexico](http://www.unam.mx/) (UNAM, Facultad de Ingeniería) in 1993 with the degree of Ingeniero Mecánico Electricista, (BS Mechanical and Electrical Engineering). I then obtained an M.Sc. (MSc in Communications and Signal Processing) and D.I.C. from [Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine](http://www.ic.ac.uk) in 1994. From 1995 until 2000 I worked in Mexico for several years as a Lecturer at ITESM and ITAM  teaching Communications and Electromagnetics related subjects.  From 2001 until 2004 I returned to the United Kingdom to obtain a Ph.D. in Computer Science at [Warwick University](Http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk) under the supervision of [Dr. Abhir Bhalerao](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/Abhir_Bhalerao) in the area of Medical Image Analysis with a thesis on Multiresolution Volumetric Texture Segmentation. At the same time, I worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at the Department of Computer Science,  University of Warwick. From 2005 to 2011 I worked as a Research Associate and then Research Fellow at The University of Sheffield in the Tumour Microcirculation Group. In May 2011 I joined the University of Sussex as a Lecturer in Biomedical Engineering. I moved to [City, University of London](http://www.city.ac.uk) in July 2013.
