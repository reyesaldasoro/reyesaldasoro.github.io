<h2> Abstract </h2>

This paper presents the results from an
investigation of asymmetries in speech articulation
on the basis of 1,502 previously published
palatograms of a wide variety of speech sounds in a
range of languages. For each palatogram, the
direction and degree of tongue-palate contact was
quantified by means of an index capturing the
degree of lateral asymmetry. The results of this
investigation show that lingual asymmetry in the
articulation of speech sounds is substantial: 83% of
the palatograms are asymmetrical. With respect to
the direction of the asymmetry it is found that the
asymmetry is more often towards the left side of the
palate (45%) than to the right side (38%). Further
analysis reveals that there are significant differences
in both the direction and the degree of the
asymmetry as a function of manner and place of
articulation.
