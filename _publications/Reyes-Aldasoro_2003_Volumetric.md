<h2> Abstract </h2>  <br> This paper considers the problem of classification of Magnetic Resonance Images using 2D and 3D texture measures. Joint statistics such as co-occurrence matrices are common for analysing texture in 2D since they are simple and effective to implement. However, the computational complexity can be prohibitive especially in 3D. In this work, we develop a texture classification strategy by a sub-band filtering technique that can be extended to 3D. We further propose a feature selection technique based on the Bhattacharyya distance measure that reduces the number of features required for the classification by selecting a set of discriminant features conditioned on a set training texture samples. We describe and illustrate the methodology by quantitatively analysing a series of images: 2D synthetic phantom, 2D natural textures, and MRI of human knees."
