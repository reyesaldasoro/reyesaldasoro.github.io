<h2> Abstract </h2>   <br>  {\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}In this work, the geometrical characteristics of two different types of cells observed with Electron Microscopy were analysed. The nuclear envelope of Wild-type HeLa cells and Chlamydia trachomatis-infected HeLa cells were automatically segmented and then modelled against a spheroid and converted to a two-dimensional surface. Geometric measurements from this surface and the volumetric nuclear envelope were extracted to compare the two types of cells. The measurements included the nuclear volume, the sphericity of the nucleus, its flatness or spikiness. In total 13 different cells were segmented: 7 Wild-type and 6 Chlamydia trachomatis-infected. The cells were statistically different in the following measurements. Wild-type HeLa cells have greater volumes than that of Chlamydia trachomatis-infected HeLa cells and they are more spherical as Jaccard index suggests. Standard deviation (\textit{σ}), and range of values for the nuclear envelope, which shows the distance of the highest peaks and deepest valleys from the spheroid, were also extracted from the modelling against a spheroid and these metrics were used to compare two different data sets in order to draw conclusions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}"
