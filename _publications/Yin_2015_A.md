<h2> Abstract </h2>

OBJECTIVE: Ultrawideband radar imaging is regarded as one of the most promising alternatives for breast cancer detection. A range of algorithms reported in literature shows satisfactory tumor detection capabilities. However, most of algorithms suffer significant deterioration or even fail when the early-stage artifact, including incident signals and skin-fat interface reflections, cannot be perfectly removed from received signals. Furthermore, fibro-glandular tissue poses another challenge for tumor detection, due to the small dielectric contrast between glandular and cancerous tissue
