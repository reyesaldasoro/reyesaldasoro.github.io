<h2> Abstract </h2>   <br>  
The extracellular matrix (ECM) controls tumour dissemination. We characterise ECM organization in human and mouse tumours, identifying three regions: tumour body, proximal invasive front and distal invasive front. Invasive areas show increased matrix density, fibre thickness, length, and alignment, with unique radial fibre orientation at the distal invasive front correlating with amoeboid invasive features. Using patient samples and murine models, we find that metastases recapitulate ECM features of the primary tumour. Ex vivo culture of murine cancer cells isolated from the different tumour regions reveals a spatial cytoskeletal and transcriptional memory. Several in vitro models recapitulate the in vivo ECM organisation showing that increased matrix induces 3D confinement supporting Rho-ROCK-Myosin II activity, while radial orientation enhances directional invasion. Spatial transcriptomics identifies a mechano-inflammatory program associated with worse prognosis across multiple tumour types. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how ECM organization shapes local invasion and distant metastasis.
