<h2> Abstract </h2>  <br> OBJECTIVE: To develop an image processing-based method to quantify the rate of extravasation of fluorescent contrast agents from tumor microvessels, and to investigate the effect of the tumor vascular disrupting agent combretastatin A-4-P (CA-4-P) on apparent tumor vascular permeability to 40 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled dextra"
