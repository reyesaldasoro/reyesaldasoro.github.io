"<h2> Abstract </h2>" "Limited contrast in transmitted light optical images from intravital microscopy is problematic for analysing tumour vascular morphology. Moreover, in some cases, changes in vasculature are visible to a human observer but are not easy to quantify. In this paper two online algorithms are presented: scale-space vessel tracing and chromatic decomposition for analysis of the vasculature of SW1222 human colorectal carcinoma xenografts growing in dorsal skin-fold ""window"" chambers in mice. Transmitted light optical images of tumours were obtained from mice treated with the tumour vascular disrupting agent, combretastatin-A-4-phosphate (CA4P), or saline. The tracing algorithm was validated against hand-traced vessels with accurate results. The measurements extracted with the algorithms confirmed the known effects of CA4P on tumour vascular topology. Furthermore, changes in the chromaticity suggest a deoxygenation of the blood with a recovery to initial levels in CA4P-treated tumours relative to the controls. The algorithms can be freely applied to other studies through the CAIMAN website (CAncer IMage ANalysis: http://www.caiman.org.uk)."
