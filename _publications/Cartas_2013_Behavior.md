<h2> Abstract </h2>  <br>The movement of small animals in well-defined environments is increasingly studied in many areas; including ecotoxicology, learning, and behavioural ecology. Here we de- scribe an algorithm designed to analyze individual foraging ants from a colony of Lasius niger. The inputs to the algorithm were images from a video sequence. The algorithm performed a series of pre-processing steps to identify the ants from the pixels, measurements were extracted and individual ants were tracked in time. The location of the ants in position and time were recorded as heat maps denoting the favorite locations of the ants. The ants were videoed in a foraging experiment on a T-maze a single trail bifurcation.
