<h2> Abstract </h2>   <br>  
Class I PI3kinases coordinate the delivery of microbicidal effectors to the phagosome by forming the phosphoinositide lipid second messenger, phosphatidylinositol (3, 4, 5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). However, the dynamics of PIP3 in neutrophils during a bacterial infection are unknown. We have therefore developed an in vivo, live zebrafish infection model that enables visualisation of dynamic changes in Class 1 PI3kinases (PI3K) signalling on neutrophil phagosomes in real-time. We have identified that on approximately 12% of neutrophil phagosomes PHAkt-eGFP, a reporter for Class 1 PI3K signalling, re-recruits in pulsatile bursts. This phenomenon occurred on phagosomes containing structurally and morphologically distinct prey, including Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium abscessus, and was dependent on the activity of the Class 1 PI3K isoform, PI3kinase Gamma. Detailed imaging suggested that pulsing phagosomes represent neutrophils transiently reopening and reclosing phagosomes. This finding challenges the concept that phagosomes remain closed after prey engulfment and we propose that neutrophils occasionally use this alternative pathway of phagosome maturation to release phagosome contents and/or to restart phagosome maturation if digestion has stalled.
