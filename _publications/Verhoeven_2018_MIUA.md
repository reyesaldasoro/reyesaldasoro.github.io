<h2> Abstract </h2>

The process of compression of air and vibration of activity in the larynx through which speech is produced is of great interest in phonetics, phonology and psychology and is related to various areas of biomedical engineering as it has a strong relationship with cochlear implants, Parkinson’s disease and stroke. One technique by means of which speech production is analysed is the use of electropalatography, in which an artificial palate, moulded to the speakers’ hard palate is introduced in the mouth. The palate contains a series of electrodes, which monitor contact between the tongue and the palate during speech production. There is interest in the symmetry or asymmetry of the movement of the tongue as this may be related to languages or right- or left-handedness, however; this has never been thoroughly studied. A specific limitation of electropalatography for symmetry studies is that palates are hand-crafted and the position of the electrodes themselves may be asymmetric. In this work, we analyse the positioning of electrodes of one electropalatography setting. The symmetry was analysed by locating the electrodes of the palate through the observation of the palate with Computed Tomography. An algorithm to segment the electrodes and find the symmetry of left and right sides of the palates is described. No significant asymmetry was found for one specific palate. The methodology presented should allow the analysis of palates to be used in larger studies of speech production.
