<h2> Abstract </h2>  <br>
Welcome to the first in a series of articles that will highlight the role of image analysis in oncology. Cancer Image Analysis (CIA) is concerned with the extraction and manipulation of useful information from oncological images, and therefore it is closely related to Cancer Imaging per se and can be seen as complementary step in the process towards diagnosis, screening, drug testing or assessing treatments. CIA is a very wide field of research, not only due to the wide range of cancer-related images, from MRI to histology to optical images, but also because image analysis has inherited many techniques from the fields of Statistics, Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision. This series will show the potential of image analysis as applied to cancer with the ultimate objective of fostering an interdisciplinary cross-fertilization that will bring benefits to clinicians, scientists and ultimately the patient.
