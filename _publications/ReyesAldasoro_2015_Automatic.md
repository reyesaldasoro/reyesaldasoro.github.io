<h2> Abstract </h2>  <br>
This work describes an automatic algorithm for the segmentation and quantification of focal adhesions from mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The main challenges solved by this algorithm are: the variability of the intensity of the focal adhesions, the detection of an outer ring, which distinguishes the cell periphery responsible for the cell migration, and the quantification of the characteristics of the focal adhesions. The algorithm detects maximal regions through gradients and uses a region-growing algorithm limited by intensity-based edges. The outer ring is calculated based on the average radial intensity from an extended centroid of the cell. Finally, traditional morphological characteristics are obtained to distinguish between two groups of cells. Two of the measurements employed showed statistical difference between two groups of cells.
