<h2> Abstract </h2>

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Combretastatin A-4 3-O-phosphate (CA4P) is in clinical trial as a tumour vascular disrupting agent (VDA) but the cause of blood flow disruption is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that activation of Rho/Rho kinase (ROCK) is fundamental to the effects of this drug in vivo
