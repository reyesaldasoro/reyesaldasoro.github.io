<h2> Abstract </h2>   <br>  
Today, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are heavily dependent on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) for positioning and navigation. However, GNSS signals are vulnerable to jamming and spoofing attacks. This poses serious security risks, especially for military operations and critical civilian missions. In order to solve this problem, an image-based geolocation system has been developed that eliminates GNSS dependency. The proposed system estimates the geographical location of the UAV by matching the aerial images taken by the UAV with previously georeferenced high-resolution satellite images. For this purpose, common visual features were determined between satellite and UAV images and matching operations were carried out using methods based on the homography matrix. Thanks to image processing, a significant relationship has been established between the area where the UAV is located and the geographical coordinates, and reliable positioning is ensured even in cases where GNSS signals cannot be used. Within the scope of the study, traditional methods such as SIFT, AKAZE, and Multiple Template Matching were compared with learning-based methods including SuperPoint, SuperGlue, and LoFTR. The results showed that deep learning-based approaches can make successful matches, especially at high altitudes.
