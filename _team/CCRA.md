My undergraduate degree is from the  [National University in Mexico](http://www.unam.mx/) (UNAM, Facultad de Ingeniería) in 1993 with the degree of Ingeniero Mecánico Electricista, (BS Mechanical and Electrical Engineering). I then obtained an M.Sc. (MSc in Communications and Signal Processing) and D.I.C. from [Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine](http://www.ic.ac.uk) in 1994. From 1995 until 2000 I worked in Mexico for several years as a Lecturer at ITESM and ITAM  teaching Communications and Electromagnetics related subjects.  From 2001 until 2004 I returned to the United Kingdom to obtain a Ph.D. in Computer Science at [Warwick University](Http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk) under the supervision of [Dr. Abhir Bhalerao](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/Abhir_Bhalerao) in the area of Medical Image Analysis with a thesis on Multiresolution Volumetric Texture Segmentation. At the same time, I worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at the Department of Computer Science,  University of Warwick. From 2005 to 2011 I worked as a Research Associate and then Research Fellow at The University of Sheffield in the Tumour Microcirculation Group. In May 2011 I joined the University of Sussex as a Lecturer in Biomedical Engineering. I moved to [City, University of London](http://www.city.ac.uk) in July 2013.
