Ananda defended his thesis "Wrist Fractures Analysis as observed with X-ray imaging" in 2022 and has returned to his previous academic position in Indonesia. His PhD research focused on the analysis of wrist fractures, with geometric semi-automatic image analysis and with CNN classification into normal and abnormal cases. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) was applied to interpret the network's activation against the location of abnormality in the radiograph.
