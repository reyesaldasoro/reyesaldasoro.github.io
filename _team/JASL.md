José Alonso graduated from Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de México (ITAM) in Telematics Engineering (2013) and Applied Mathematics (2014). He received his PhD in Biomedical Engineering working at the School of Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering (SMCSE) at City, University of London. His PhD research focused on the automated analysis of moving patterns in migrating cells’ movement. Moving his focus "closer to the patient", José Alonso joined CEMRG early in 2019 as a Post-Doctoral Research Associate, where he is currently developing image processing and computer vision algorithms for the analysis of cardiac images.
